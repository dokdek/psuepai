const text = "I wanted to create a bot to assist with Japanese language learning. I used to use a website called Wanikani which was a paid subscription for a spaced repetition system of learning. I personally felt the price was a bit high for what was essentially flashcards and thought that I could do it myself. Additionally, I fell behind on my reviews because it required me to visit the site every time. I figured that I'm always on Discord talking to friends so why not have a bot that can remind me when reviews are due and just do them through Discord. So the end goal was to create a very stripped down and light version of Wanikani that is operated through a Discord bot. It should allow users to learn and review kanji and vocabulary, as well as remind them when reviews are due."
