User data and the kanji/vocabularly data is stored on a MongoDB database and accessed via Mongoose. It utilizes mainly promises and async/await functions to communicate to the API and database. A script was created to query various external APIs to gather information to build the data model to populate the database of kanji and vocabulary. The script iterates through the vocabulary list and queries a Japanese-English dictionary API to extract the readings and meanings.";
