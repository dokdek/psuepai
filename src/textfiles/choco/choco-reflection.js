const text = "Choco is built using JavaScript on Node implementing the Discord.js Node module which allows for 100% promise based interaction with the Discord API. It is connected to a MongoDB database via Mongoose to keep track of user information and deployed on Google Cloud Platform. This time around, I was a lot more comfortable working with promises and async/await functions compared to my very first Discord bot, this allowed me to write cleaner and more eligible code as there are a lot less nested promises/callbacks. This was also my first attempt at writing a JavaScript script to query a few APIs to gather information to build out my database of kanji and vocabulary. The script iterates through the vocabulary list and queries a Japanese-English dictionary API to extract the readings and meanings. One of the main issues encountered was a rate limit as I attempted initially to call the API as fast as possible, which consisted of over 6000 calls, so I quickly hit that limit. The way I had overcome this was setting a time interval between each API call as to not hit that rate limit. Next challenge I'd like to do is a companion website so it is accessible from more than one source, it will be interesting to deal with sync between the two systems to ensure that they don't overwrite each other and only one source of truth exists.";
