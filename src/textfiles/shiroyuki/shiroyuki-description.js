const text = "I wanted to create a bot to search and create guild listings in Discord for game communities. Currently, how most game related Discord servers operate is that people just post listings in a channel and it just sits there and the channel becomes cluttered. There is also no way to easy filter the listings to only display the ones you're interested in. I wanted a way for users to search and filter only for listings based on their criteria and have results be sent via DMs to reduce clutter in channels."
