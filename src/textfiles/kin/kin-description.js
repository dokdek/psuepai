  'My initial goal was to create an envelope budgeting website. Envelope budgeting is a system where every dollar that comes in is given a role before it\'s even spent, we budget every dollar until there is zero left. This allows a proactive method to budgeting. I used to use a paid service called "You Need a Budget", but I thought that I would try my hand at creating a clone of it for personal use as I was tired of paying the yearly subscription fees. This was my first "real" project that I would build from the ground up. I\'d had an interest in learning full-stack development and learning how to use web frameworks, thus I decided to a popular stack consisting of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. Since it would be my first project I also wanted to use a CSS framework to assist me, and ended up deciding on Material UI for it\'s popularity, features, and extensive documentation. I ended up using Firebase as an authentication server for users and built a REST API for my frontend to communicate with the Express backend which is connected to a MongoDB database.';
