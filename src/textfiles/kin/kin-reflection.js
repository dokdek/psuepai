The front end is styled using Material UI and uses modern React features such as hooks and functional components rather than classes. The back end is an Express server that is connected to MongoDB via Mongoose and uses Axios for REST API requests from the front end. Finally, user authentication is handled via Firebase and a JSON web token is issued and stored in the userâ€™s cookies for subsequent requests to protected routes.";
