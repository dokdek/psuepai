const text = "Considering this was my first project, I ended up learning a lot. Does the project work? Mostly. Is it full of bugs? Yes. Even though the project is \"functional\", I'm not very satisfied with how it is in its current state. I intend to keep working on it and updating it as it is a project I do intend to use everyday. In the future I want to rely less on component frameworks such as Material UI and build my own components, as in my opinion, they are too opinionated and restrictive. I also want to brush up and learn on REST API routing standards as even though I did build an API, it only contains two main routes and uses only GET and POST requests. Lastly, I would plan out the database and models in advance, rather than have everything in one model as properties as it is right now. This would help with the complexity of querying and improve the performance as right now there are many various multi nested loops for a lot of actions. Overall, I consider the project to be a good experience and I've definitely learned a lot along the way.";
